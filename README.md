## Quick Start
The game is designed to be run on an iPad, but also works on M1 Macs! It has not been tested with Mac Catalyst. To start up the game, just run the app project!

> **Warning**<br>
> The app project is not compatible with Simulator, since it relies on the Create ML framework. Please be sure to build and the app for a physical device.
