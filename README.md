**One Step Ahead**<br>

By Ethan Marshall :)

# Quick Start
The game is designed for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Silicon Macs! To start up the app, you can either download and run the Xcode project or download the game right from the App Store!

> **Warning**<br>
> Standard gameplay is not compatible with the Xcode Simulator, since the app relies on the Create ML framework. Please be sure to build and run the app on a physical device.

# Running on Simulator
If you would like to run the game with the Xcode Simulator or use SwiftUI previews, use the following steps to disable AI judging:

1. Find all uses of the `getAIscore()` function and replace them with a static `50.0`, or whichever substitute score you would like to assign the AI during games.
2. Comment out or delete all code in the `MLServices.swift` file.
